# Madgwick filter for 9 dof MPU6050 + HMC5883l

This is an ESP-IDF project for ESP32-S3 (and similar) which reads the 9dof data from sensors and then interprets them via a Madgwick filter. The purpose of this program is to test and experiment with the Madgwick filter for the purposes of a masters thesis.

## How to use example

The project can be used by compiling the code using ESP-IDF with minimum version 5.2.1
